Day 1: Introduction to Variables and Data Types

Magic Calculator: Create a program that asks the user for two numbers and performs the basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Challenge participants to add a magical operation, like finding the square root, to make it more interesting.

Age Classifier: Write a program that takes a person's age as input and classifies them into interesting categories such as "Baby," "Teenager," "Adult," or "Senior." Include creative age ranges and messages for each category.

Day 2: Conditional Statements and Data Structures

Adventure Game: Develop a text-based adventure game where players make choices by entering numbers. Use conditional statements to guide the player through different scenarios, like choosing paths in a mysterious forest or solving puzzles in a haunted castle.

Library Catalog: Create a program that simulates a library catalog. Allow users to search for books, display availability, and even borrow books. Make it feel like a virtual library adventure!

Day 3: Loops and Functions

Number Guessing Game: Design a number guessing game where the users generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the Computer has to guess it within a limited number of attempts.

Recursive Art: Challenge participants to create a recursive function that generates intricate patterns or art, such as fractals. Let them experiment with different shapes and colors.

Day 4: Modules, Libraries, and File Handling

Weather App: Build a weather application that fetches weather data and displays it to the user. Participants can choose their location to get weather updates.

Recipe Organizer: Create a program where users can input their favorite recipes and organize them in a digital cookbook. Allow users to search for recipes and even suggest ingredients for a surprise recipe.

Day 5: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Virtual Zoo: Construct a virtual zoo using classes and objects. Each animal can have unique behaviors and interactions. Participants can create their own zoo with custom animals and behaviors.

Superhero Showdown: Design a game where participants create superhero characters as objects with various powers. Challenge them to make their superheroes battle against each other using object-oriented principles.

Day 7: Exception Handling and Data Structures

Maze Solver: Create a maze-solving program that reads maze layouts from a text file. Challenge participants to write a robust algorithm using exception handling to navigate through the maze.

Music Playlist Manager: Develop a music playlist manager that reads song data from a file. Allow users to create and manage playlists, and even suggest songs based on preferences.

Day 8: Data Structure Continued

Tower of Hanoi: Implement the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using stacks. Challenge participants to solve it for various numbers of disks and visualize the process.

Restaurant Queue: Simulate a restaurant's queue system using queues. Customers can join the queue, and waiters can serve them. Challenge participants to optimize the queue management.

Day 9: Algorithms

Treasure Hunt: Create a treasure hunt game where participants write an algorithm to find hidden treasures on a map. Add obstacles and challenges along the way.

Algorithmic Art Generator: Challenge participants to use algorithms to generate unique pieces of art. They can experiment with different sorting algorithms to arrange shapes or colors in interesting ways.
